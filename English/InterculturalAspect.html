                        <h2>Assignment related to the movie "Patser"</h2>
                        <h3>The purpose of this assignment was to find two articles that resemble situations that took place in the film and on the basis of these articles
                            explain cultural differences in reality. This task was done in groups so below you will see my
                            contribution to this group work.

                       <h4>Slain police officer who saved a hostage 'died a hero'</h4>
                       <p><a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2018/03/24/europe/france-trebes-officer-dead/index.html">de link naar het artikel</a></p>
                       <p>To the south of France an alleged ISIS-inspired terrorist hijacked a car killing one person in the vehicle and wounding the other. 
                           The terrorist then shot at four police officers who were jogging in Carcassonne. 
                           The shooter tried to run down the four police officers, one of the officers got wounded. 
                           The alleged terrorist then fled to a nearby Super U supermarket in Trèbes by car, where he opened fire and killed a worker and a customer. 
                           The fugitive soon after took a woman who was shopping at the store as a hostage. 
                           Lt. Col. Arnaud Beltrame who was at the scene tried to negotiate with the alleged ISIS-inspired terrorist and offered to swap places with the hostage. 
                           Arnaud Beltrame was shot in the neck while entering the market and died later that day. 
                           As soon as the police heard the gunfire, they barged into the market and killed the shooter.</p>
                           <p>The Lt. Col. Arnaud Beltrame left behind a wife and received a number of awards for bravery.</p>
                           <p>Developed countries have a more nationalistic view than underdeveloped countries.
                               Developed countries want to maintain a national identity based on shared characteristics such as culture, language, race, religion, political goals or a belief in a common ancestry.
                               This national identity is also used to preserve the honor and righteousness of the authoritative figures. 
                               The media will for example write stories of the police where they are regarded heroes as in the news article explained above to boost the nationalistic morale.
                               Saying something like “This man served and died for his country”. 
                               This also happened towards the end of the film Patser (2018), where there was a hostage situation and police
                               intervened. 
                               A friend of the four protagonists who was a policeman had to sacrifice himself tosave them. 
                               This policeman was regarded as a hero and was given a posthumous award for bravery.</p>
                            <p>In most underdeveloped countries police are regarded as corrupt authoritative figures that will exploit civilians and also abuse their power for personal gain. 
                                This will cause civilians to see authority as corrupt and not needed. This will then lower the nationalistic view of the people from the underdeveloped country. 
                                The people that come from these less developed countries will start seeing all police as corrupt figures, 
                                which is also seen in the film Patser where the friend of the four protagonists is a policeman. 
                                This policeman has lost the respect of his friends because they see him as someone who is there to make people’s lives harder. 
                                Rather than putting him in a good light and seeing him as someone who will one day be of assistance to his country.</p>
                        <h2>Personal Experiences</h2>
                        <h3>Here I give two examples of cultural differences that I have experienced. An explanation is given why this would cause conflict in
                            professional interactions.</h3>
                        <h4>Greeting</h4>
                        <p>The first cultural difference I experienced in Belgium is the way people greet each other. 
                            For example, the first time I was working a vacation job, my coworkers came up to me really closely and tried to go in for cheek kisses while I stood there and held out my hand. 
                            This created some tension with some coworkers because they took offense. 
                            In Belgium, cheek kissing is a common greeting to relatives or friends. 
                            Here, in the Flemish part of Belgium, usually three kisses are exchanged. 
                            Usually women will kiss both women and men, while men will kiss women but withstand from kissing other men. 
                            Coming from a mixed household(a father from Nigeria(Africa) and a mom from Belgium(Europe)), I was not used to cheek kissing as a greeting. 
                            I have only ever known to just make verbal greetings or to shakehands with relatives and friends.</p>
                        <p>If this form of greeting is used in other countries in professional interactions where it’s custom to give each other space while greeting – 
                            for example, in Japan, greeting people is
                            expressed with bowing – it could cause conflicts in professional interactions, because the gesture of cheek kissing is reserved for family or couples. 
                            A way to cope with such differences in greetings is to do your research on the culture of the country you will be staying in and will have professional interactions in.</p>
                        <h4>Facial expressions</h4>    
                        <p>Prior research revealed that facial expressions are a hard-wired behavior with evolutionary origins. But there are a studies that challenge this idea. 
                            These studies say that facial expressions are affected by culture and have a different meaning in these certain cultures.
                            This may create a certain social barrier between people with cultural differences and will bring certain problems to the table.</p>
                        <p>
                            For example Europeans rely on the eyebrows and mouth to express emotions while asians will rely on the eyes. 
                            These cultural differences can lead to misinterpreted signals duringprofessional interactions.
