                   <p>In the second semester (2017-2018) we made a group work on app development. We ourselves were allowed to choose the idea of our app.
                      For us this was 
                   </p>
                   <h2>ChargeBy</h2>
                   <img src="../Images/logo.JPG" alt="">
                   <p>  In short, this app ensures that users can become part of a network that shares power with each other. This is done on the basis of, for example
                        sockets protected by the app that will be installed on the wall of the owner's home. By using the app then a user can
                        receive power from this owner.
                   </p>
                   <h3>My personal work in the group will be mentioned below. In the beginning, everyone in the group contributed to the concept of the app. 
                       But because we were with eight group members, the division of labor and initiative were sometimes still difficult. My personal task in this project
                       was to see if there were already apps that had the same concept as our application.
                   </h3>
                   <p>There are a few similar ideas out there, ranging from apps with which you can find bars, coffee houses, etc with free charging possibilities, 
                       to apps that provide directions to public electricity stations where motorized vehicles canbe charged. 
                       PlugShare is one of the latter. It's the most well known accurate and complete charging station map worldwide. 
                       It has the world's biggest andmost accurate charging map (over 140,000 public stations including all major
                       networks in North America and Europe). 
                       The app includes compatibility tests, real time views of the usable stations, reviews from other drivers, a user
                       extendable database (users can add new charging stations as they discover them). 
                       There is also the app EV Charging which is the same as PlugShare but not that well known.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        What makes our application special is that the charging stations won't be exclusively owned by the government or companies, but also by the commons. 
                        This incentivises civilians to install power outlets on the outside of their homes and connect it to the app. 
                        This power outlet will be connected to their homeâ€™s electrical system and raise their electricity bill. 
                        This is where people will try to create their own electricity using green energy 
                        (electricity harvested from renewable resources available through technologies like solarpanels and windmills). 
                        Users will have to install ChargeBy in order gain access these domestic, crowd-sourced charging stations, 
                        ensuring a robust structure to employ profitable strategies (such as marked up charging rates(luxury tax) that benefit the user.
